tweet is a very simple command-line tweeter. That is, it allows you to
send a twitter update to a given user account. It doesn't do anything
else. Well, actually, it also shortens any links automatically in the
message you submit, but that's all.  Hmm, no, wait, I guess it now also
allows you to follow or unfollow accounts.  So there's that.
