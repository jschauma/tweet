tweet is a very simple command-line tweeter. That is, it allows you to
send a twitter update to a given user account. It doesn't do anything
else. Well, actually, it also allows you to follow or unfollow accounts as
well as block and unblock users.  So there's that.  Also, this tool
suffers from feeping creatures and will (or already has) probably
spawn(ed) additional features making it not all that very simple anymore.
